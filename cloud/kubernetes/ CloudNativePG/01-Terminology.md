| [Node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/)                                                   | A _node_ is a worker machine in Kubernetes, either virtual or physical, where all services necessary to run pods are managed by the control plane node(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/)                                                    | A _pod_ is the smallest computing unit that can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster and is composed of one or more containers that share network and storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)                                       | A _service_ is an abstraction that exposes as a network service an application that runs on a group of pods and standardizes important features such as service discovery across applications, load balancing, failover, and so on.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)                                               | A _secret_ is an object that is designed to store small amounts of sensitive data such as passwords, access keys, or tokens, and use them in pods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Storage Class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/)                                     | A _storage class_ allows an administrator to define the classes of storage in a cluster, including provisioner (such as AWS EBS), reclaim policies, mount options, volume expansion, and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)                              | A _persistent volume_ (PV) is a resource in a Kubernetes cluster that represents storage that has been either manually provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned by a _storage class_ controller. A PV is associated with a pod using a _persistent volume claim_ and its lifecycle is independent of any pod that uses it. Normally, a PV is a network volume, especially in the public cloud. |
| [Local Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local)                             | A _local persistent volume_ (LPV) is a persistent volume that exists only on the particular node where the pod that uses it is running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Persistent Volume Claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) | A _persistent volume claim_ (PVC) represents a request for storage, which might include size, access mode, or a particular storage class. Similar to how a pod consumes node resources, a PVC consumes the resources of a PV.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)                        | A _namespace_ is a logical and isolated subset of a Kubernetes cluster and can be seen as a _virtual cluster_ within the wider physical cluster. Namespaces allow administrators to create separated environments based on projects, departments, teams, and so on.                                                                                                                                              |
| [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)                                             | _Role Based Access Control_ (RBAC), also known as _role-based security_, is a method used in computer systems security to restrict access to the network and resources of a system to authorized users only. Kubernetes has a native API to control roles at the namespace and cluster level and associate them with specific resources and individuals.                                                         |
| [CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)                      | A _custom resource definition_ (CRD) is an extension of the Kubernetes API and allows developers to create new data types and objects, _called custom resources_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)                                       | An _operator_ is a custom resource that automates those steps that are normally performed by a human operator when managing one or more applications or given services. An operator assists Kubernetes in making sure that the resource's defined state always matches the observed one.                                                                                                                         |

|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Instance                                                      | A Postgres server process running and listening on a pair "IP address(es)" and "TCP port" (usually 5432).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Primary                                                       | A PostgreSQL instance that can accept both read and write operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Replica                                                       | A PostgreSQL instance replicating from the only primary instance in a cluster and is kept updated by reading a stream of Write-Ahead Log (WAL) records. A replica is also known as _standby_ or _secondary_ server. PostgreSQL relies on physical streaming replication (async/sync) and file-based log shipping (async). |
| Hot Standby                                                   | PostgreSQL feature that allows a _replica_ to accept read-only workloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Cluster                                                       | To be intended as High Availability (HA) Cluster: a set of PostgreSQL instances made up by a single primary and an optional arbitrary number of replicas.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Replica Cluster                                               | A CloudNativePG `Cluster` that is in continuous recovery mode from a selected PostgreSQL cluster, normally residing outside the Kubernetes cluster. It is a feature that enables multi-cluster deployments in private, public, hybrid, and multi-cloud contexts.                                                          |
| Designated Primary                                            | A PostgreSQL standby instance in a replica cluster that is in continuous recovery from another PostgreSQL cluster and that is designated to become primary in case the replica cluster becomes primary.                                                                                                                   |
| Superuser                                                     | In PostgreSQL a _superuser_ is any role with both `LOGIN` and `SUPERUSER` privileges. For security reasons, CloudNativePG performs administrative tasks by connecting to the `postgres` database as the `postgres` user via ` peer` authentication over the local Unix Domain Socket.                                     |
| [WAL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html) | Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) is a standard method for ensuring data integrity in database management systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| PVC group                                                     | A PVC group in CloudNativePG's terminology is a group of related PVCs belonging to the same PostgreSQL instance, namely the main volume containing the PGDATA (`storage`) and the volume for WALs (`walStorage`).                                                                                                         |

## Cloud terminology

| Resource | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Region   | A _region_ in the Cloud is an isolated and independent geographic area organized in _availability zones_. Zones within a region have very little round-trip network latency.                                                   |
| Zone     | An _availability zone_ in the Cloud (also known as _zone_) is an area in a region where resources can be deployed. Usually, an availability zone corresponds to a data center or an isolated building of the same data center. |
